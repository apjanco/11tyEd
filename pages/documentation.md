## Making changes to this site

To make changes to a page on this site, you first need to login to the admin page.  
1. Add `/admin` to the current web address in your browser.  For example, change `https://reees.netlify.app` to [`https://reees.netlify.app/admin`](https://reees.netlify.app/admin).
2. You should then see a button asking to `Login with Netlify Identity`, click on that button.    
3. Now it'll ask for an account.  To use your Google account, click on `Continue with Google`. You'll be asked to enter your Google username and password. If you have GitHub or Netlify accounts, those will also work. 
4. If logged in, you'll now see a list of the current pages.  You can click on your group's page to see and edit the contents.
