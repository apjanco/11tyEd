## WHAT IS COLOR?

Color is an effect caused by the reflection of cer-
tain rays of light. In order to understand this statement, it is necessary that we know what light is. Science teaches us that light is a form of intense vibration which reaches the earth direct from the sun. These vibrations affect certain nerves of the retina of the eye, causing the sensa-
tion known as color.

In the study of color, or in practice, it is neces-
sary that we have a standard. The standard col-
ors are those seen in the spectrum or in the rain-
bow. These colors are selected as standard colors
because they are the true colors as reflected by
pure light and they never change.

In dealing with pigments the primary colors are
yellow, red and blue. They are called primary
colors because all other colors are produced from
them, and because they can not be produced by
mixing other colors. In other words, they are,
the original colors from which all other colors are
produced.
