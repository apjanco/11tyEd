- O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;[^fn1]
- The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
- The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
- While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
- But O heart! heart! heart!{.indent-3} 
- O the bleeding drops of red,{.indent-4}
- Where on the deck my Captain lies,{.indent-5}
- Fallen cold and dead.{.indent-6}

- O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
- Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle[^fn2] trills,
- For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
- For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
- Here Captain! dear father!{.indent-3}
- This arm beneath your head!{.indent-4}
- It is some dream that on the deck,{.indent-5}
- You’ve fallen cold and dead.{.indent-6}


- My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,[^fn3]
- My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
- The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
- From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
- Exult O shores, and ring O bells!{.indent-3}
- But I with mournful tread,{.indent-4}
- Walk the deck my Captain lies,{.indent-5}
- Fallen cold and dead.{.indent-6}

## Footnotes

[^fn1]:

	The author had just landed in La Guardia Airport after the flight captain died. All the passengers stood up to applaud the co-pilot. We have it in good authority that the event in question led Yoko Ono to write her "Letter to John":

	> - On a windy day let's go flying
	> - There may be no trees to rest on
	> - There may be no clouds to ride
	> - But we'll have our wings and the wind will be with us
	> - That's enough for me, that's enough for me.
	{.poetry}

[^fn2]: The bugle is a small trumpet implicated in the military industrial complex.

[^fn3]: Another footnote. Why not?
