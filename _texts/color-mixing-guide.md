## WHAT IS COLOR?

Color is an effect caused by the reflection of cer-
tain rays of light. In order to understand this statement, it is necessary that we know what light is. Science teaches us that light is a form of intense vibration which reaches the earth direct from the sun. These vibrations affect certain nerves of the retina of the eye, causing the sensa-
tion known as color.

In the study of color, or in practice, it is neces-
sary that we have a standard. The standard col-
ors are those seen in the spectrum or in the rain-
bow. These colors are selected as standard colors
because they are the true colors as reflected by
pure light and they never change.

In dealing with pigments the primary colors are
yellow, red and blue. They are called primary
colors because all other colors are produced from
them, and because they can not be produced by
mixing other colors. In other words, they are,
the original colors from which all other colors are
produced.

### WARM AND COLD COLORS

Cold and warm colors: Red warm, blue cold,
yellow bright. White, which is also a cold color
when added to black makes a cold gray, Yellow
added to red forms a warm orange.


### MEANING OF COLORS

White is said to mean purity; blue, fidelity or
truth; red, love or sacrifice; green, envy; pink,
modesty; violet, innocence; yellow, jealousy;
black, sorrow or distress, and lavender, passion.

### ART OF COLOR MIXING

Mixing colors is an art in itself. With a com-
bination of the chief colors â€” red, yellow, blue
(and black and white), thousands of shades ant
hues may be produced.

Mixed in various proportions, either in twos, 01
all three together, these three colors produce
every hue in nature or in art, every tint that is
physically possible.

- The primary colors are yellow, red and blue.

- The secondary colors are orange, violet and
green.

- The tertiary colors are citron, russet and olive.

The secondary colors are made as follows: Yel-
low and red make orange, red and blue make vio-
let, yellow and blue make green.

The tertiary colors are mixed from the second-
ary colors as follows: Orange and violet make
russet, violet and green make olive, orange and
green make citron.

Black, white and gray are natural tones in
which no color is apparent: White pales but does
not brighten any color. Yellow is the brighten-
ing color and always stands out strong and ad-
vancing; to deepen a color use its complementary
color; to deepen yellow add purple; to deepen red
add blue; to deepen blue add burnt sienna, then
you will have purity of color*


### THE TWO EXTREMES OP WARM AND COLD

Vermilion or any other red of orange hue
(warm). Bluish blue (cold). These two colors
mixed together in certain proportions form light
brown, dark brown, red brown, neutral brown and
scarlet red. Purple made from this combination
is inferior.
