  <h1>UNDERGRADUATE THINK TANK TO ADVANCE DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION IN RUSSIAN, EAST EUROPEAN & EURASIAN STUDIES</h1>

<p>
  Think tank scholars work with faculty mentors and a research team on a digital humanities project of their choice,

  Think tank scholars take a guided tour of Moscow or St. Petersburg with the School of Russian & Asian Studies (SRAS).
  
  Think tank scholars receive remote access to the rich research collections and scholarly databases of the University of Illinois Library. They will join in thematic seminars, training workshops, and professional networking sessions as part of the Summer Research Laboratory on Russia, East Europe, and Eurasia. These research programs are supported by the US Dept. of State and co-hosted by the Russian, East European, and Eurasian Center (REEEC) and the Slavic Reference Service (SRS) at Illinois.
  
  Think tank scholars participate in an online digital humanities 1-day workshop with the Princeton University Slavic Digital Humanities Working Group.
  
  Think tank scholars present at the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES) virtual national convention in November 2021.
  
  Think tank projects be published on the think tank website upon completion.
